# Iceberg

The project began in a DSP module assignment. The project required to only focus on DSP tools and techniques to approach this problem and it was quite interesting but the results I could generate were quite minimal. The aim for starting it again is to first port everything over from MATLAB to Python, and then continue the project along with further exploration with other tools. I want to use this opportunity to explore more DSP tools, data science tools, machine learning tools and deep learning tools. I do not think there is a clear solution here, so it will be fun to explore it from a lot of different angles.

## Assignment brief

This project began as assignment in DSP. Below is the excerpt from the assignment:

> This study is about understand the variation of climatic and glaciological contributions to West Greenland iceberg discharge in the Twentieth Century. Iceberg discharge is a major component of the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. While bulk estimates of discharge variation over time exist, inferred remotely from measurements of grounding line ice velocities or surface mass balance calculations, few detailed measurements of discharge itself from individual marine-terminating glaciers exist until recent years. However, it has recently been shown, through a combination of ocean-iceberg modelling and system identification, that the century-long record of iceberg numbers crossing 48¬∞ùëÅ in the West Atlantic is a good first-order proxy for discharge from at least south and west Greenland. This case study aims to measure, track and explore the time-varying correlation of ice sheet, oceanic and climatic forcing of iceberg discharge from these areas over the Twentieth Century. The input variables to be used are Surface Mass Balance (SMB), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Labrador Sea Surface Temperature (LSST). The output variable to be modelled is I48N, the monthly iceberg counts from the U.S. Coast Guard‚Äôs International Ice Patrol over 1901-2018.

## Access to data

I am not sure if the data should be shared publically yet without permission. So, if you want access to it, raise an issue and I will contact Cranfield University and request for permission.

## Uncertainties

- What literature is available for this topic?
- Are there general guidelines to approaching something of this nature?
- What information can be extracted from just this data?
- Will the expansion of data scope help the project? (i.e. Comparing results here with another source for more insights)
- If so, where and what should be looked at?

# Usage

I expect the project to contain a proper `requirements.txt` file to help quickly setup the environment required for the project, so it can easily be downloaded and used.

# Maintenance

I do not intend to maintain this project on a regular basis yet. If I feel like I am picking up steam, then I will put in more time and effort, otherwise it will be on a semi-regular basis.
